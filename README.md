# This is a calculator made only using python and it's modules.

Features of this calculator:
- Simple calculations(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, squaring, cubing, exponents larger than 3, square rooting and cube rooting)
- Sequence calculations(can currently do arithmetic and geometric progression)
- Graph Plotting(can plot graphs as long as the function has a polynomial degree of 3 or below)
- Base-n calculations(compute values of any data types except octal)

Modules required for this program: 
* matplotlib.pyplot
* numpy
* pyinstaller(to convert .py files to .exe)

Go ahead and run this code on your terminal. It has also been converted to an excutable file for Windows users to run locally. Click [Here](https://github.com/eplasbaba-uwu/calculator-python/blob/main/dist/calculator.exe) to go to the file directory and download from there if you wish to do so.



Finally, I would like to declare that this calculator is not perfect will be improved later. If you might have any suggestions, here is my gmail:
